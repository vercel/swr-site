# Suspense

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨" type="error">
  React still <strong>doesn't recommend</strong> using `Suspense` in data frameworks like SWR (<a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html#suspense-in-data-frameworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More information</a>). These APIs may change in the future as the results of our research.
</Callout>

You can enable the `suspense` option to use SWR with React Suspense:

```jsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile () {
  const { data } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher, { suspense: true })
  return <div>hello, {data.name}</div>
}

function App () {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>loading...</div>}>
      <Profile/>
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

<Callout>
  Note that the `suspense` option is not allowed to change in the lifecycle.
</Callout>

In Suspense mode, `data` is always the fetch response (so you don't need to check if it's `undefined`).
But if an error occurred, you need to use an [error boundary](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html#handling-errors) to catch it:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<h2>Could not fetch posts.</h2>}>
  <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading posts...</h1>}>
    <Profile />
  </Suspense>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

<Callout>
Suspense mode suspends rendering until the data is ready, which means it causes waterfall problems easily. To avoid that, you should prefetch resources before rendering. [More information](/docs/prefetching)
</Callout>

### Note: With Conditional Fetching [#note-with-conditional-fetching]

Normally, when you enabled `suspense` it's guaranteed that `data` will always be ready on render:

```jsx
function Profile () {
  const { data } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher, { suspense: true })

  // `data` will never be `undefined`
  // ...
}
```

However, when using it together with conditional fetching or dependent fetching, `data` will be `undefined` if the request is **paused**:

```jsx
function Profile () {
  const { data } = useSWR(isReady ? '/api/user' : null, fetcher, { suspense: true })

  // `data` will be `undefined` if `isReady` is false
  // ...
}
```

If you want to read more technical details about this restriction, check [the discussion here](https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/357#issuecomment-627089889).

### Server-Side Rendering [#server-side-rendering]

When using suspense mode on the server-side (including pre-rendering in Next.js), it's **required** to provide the initial data via [fallbackData or fallback](/docs/with-nextjs#pre-rendering-with-default-data). This means that you can't use `Suspense` to fetch data on the server side, but either doing fully client-side data fetching, or fetch the data via the framework level data fetching method(such as getStaticProps in Next.js). More discussions can be found [here](https://github.com/vercel/swr/issues/1906).
