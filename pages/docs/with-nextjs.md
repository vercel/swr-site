# Usage with Next.js

## Client Side Data Fetching

If your page contains frequently updating data, and you donâ€™t need to pre-render the data, SWR is a perfect fit and no special setup needed: just import `useSWR` and use the hook inside any components that use the data.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- First, immediately show the page without data. You can show loading states for missing data.
- Then, fetch the data on the client side and display it when ready.

This approach works well for user dashboard pages, for example. Because a dashboard is a private, user-specific page, SEO is not relevant and the page doesnâ€™t need to be pre-rendered. The data is frequently updated, which requires request-time data fetching.

## Pre-rendering

If the page must be pre-rendered, Next.js supports [2 forms of pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching):  
**Static Generation (SSG)** and **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**.

Together with SWR, you can pre-render the page for SEO, and also have features such as caching, revalidation, focus tracking, refetching on interval in the client side.

You can pass the pre-fetched data as the initial value to the `initialData` option. For example together with [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation):

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // `getStaticProps` is invoked on the server-side,
  // so this `fetcher` function will be executed on the server-side.
  const posts = await fetcher('/api/posts')
  return { props: { posts } }
}

function Posts (props) {
  // Here the `fetcher` function will be executed on the client-side.
  const { data } = useSWR('/api/posts', fetcher, { initialData: props.posts })

  // ...
}
```

The page is still pre-rendered. That means it's SEO friendly, can be cached and accessed very fast. But after hydration, itâ€™s also fully powered by SWR in the client side. 
Which means the data can be dynamic and update itself over time and user interactions.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  In the example above, <code>fetcher</code> is used to load the data from both client and server, 
  and it needs to support both environments. But this is not a requirement. You can use different ways to load data from server or client.
