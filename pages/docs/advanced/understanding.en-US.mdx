# Understanding SWR

## State Machine [#state-machine]

`useSWR` returns `data`, `error`, `isLoading`, and `isValidating` depending on the state of the `fetcher` function. This diagrams describe how SWR returns values in some scenarios.

### Fetch and Revalidate [#fetch-and-revalidate]

This pattern is to fetch data and revalidate it later.

### Key Change [#key-change]

This pattern is to fetch data and change the key and revalidate it later.

### Key Change + Previous Data [#key-change--previous-data]

This pattern is to fetch data and change the key and revalidate it later with the `keepPreviousData` option.

### Fallback [#fallback]

This pattern is to fetch data and revalidate it later with fallback data.

## Combining with isLoading and isValidating for better UX [#combining-with-isloading-and-isvalidating-for-better-ux]

Comparing to the existing `isValidating` value, `isLoading` is a new property that can help you for the more general loading cases for UX.

- `isValidating` becomes `true` whenever there is an ongoing request **whether the data is loaded or not**
- `isLoading` becomes `true` when there is an ongoing request and **data is not loaded yet**.

Simply saying you can use `isValidating` for indicating everytime there is an ongoing revalidation, and `isLoading` for indicating that SWR is revalidating but there is no data yet to display.

<Callout emoji="📝">
  Fallback data and previous data are not considered "loaded data," so when you use fallback data or enable the keepPreviousData option, you might have data to display.
</Callout>

```jsx
function Stock() {
  const { data, isLoading, isValidating } = useSWR(STOCK_API, fetcher, {
    refreshInterval: 3000
  });

  // If it's still loading the initial data, there is nothing to display.
  // We return a skeleton here.
  if (isLoading) return <div className="skeleton" />;

  // Otherwise, display the data and a spinner that indicates a background
  // revalidation.
  return (
    <>
      <div>${data}</div>
      {isValidating ? <div className="spinner" /> : null}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Return previous data for better UX [#return-previous-data-for-better-ux]

When doing data fetching based on continuous user actions, e.g. real-time search when typing, keeping the previous fetched data can improve the UX a lot. `keepPreviousData` is an option to enable that behavior. Here's a simple search UI:

```jsx
function Search() {
  const [search, setSearch] = React.useState('');

  const { data, isLoading } = useSWR(`/search?q=${search}`, fetcher, {
    keepPreviousData: true
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={search}
        onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />

      <div className={isLoading ? "loading" : ""}>
        {data?.products.map(item => <Product key={item.id} name={item.name} />)
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

With `keepPreviousData` enabled, you will still get the previous data even if you change the SWR key and the data for the new key starts loading again.

## Dependency Collection for performance [#dependency-collection-for-performance]

SWR only triggers re-rendering when the states used in the component have been updated. If you only use `data` in the component, SWR ignores the updates of other properties like `isValidating`, and `isLoading`. This reduces rendering counts a lot. More information can be found [here](/docs/advanced/performance#dependency-collection).

## onSuccess Callback [#on-success-callback]

Sometimes you may want to run some side effects right after the data is fetched successfully. You can use the `onSuccess` callback option to do that.

```jsx
const { data } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher, {
  onSuccess: (data, key, config) => {
    // Track successful API calls
    analytics.track('API Success', {
      endpoint: key,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      data: data
    });
  }
});
```

SWR will call the `onSuccess` callback with the fetched data, the key, and the config object. This is useful for analytics, logging, or any other side effects you want to perform after a successful fetch.

### `onSuccess` with deduplication

One of the features of SWR is deduplication, which means that if the same key is being used in multiple places at the same time, SWR will only fetch the data once and share it among those components.

Only the first `onSuccess` callback defined will be called for the first successful fetch, even if `onSuccess` is defined in multiple places.

Example:

```jsx
const FirstComponent = () => {
  const { data } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher, {
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      // this on success will be called
      console.log('First component success:', data);
    }
  });
  return <div>{data?.name}</div>;
};

const SecondComponent = () => {
  const { data } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher, {
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      // this on success will NOT be called
      console.log('Second component success:', data);
    }
  });
  return <div>{data?.email}</div>;
};

const App = () => (
  <>
    <FirstComponent />
    <SecondComponent />
  </>
);
```

The example above will only log the success message from the first component when the data is fetched successfully, even though both components have their own `onSuccess` callbacks. This is because SWR deduplicates requests for the same key.

For this reason, you should avoid using `onSuccess` to set local state in the `onSuccess` callback, as it may lead to unexpected behavior when multiple components are using the same key.

Also, the `onSuccess` callback is not called when the data is loaded from the cache, only when it is fetched from the network. If you need to run side effects for cached data, consider using the `useEffect` hook in combination with SWR's data.

```jsx
const { data } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher);

useEffect(() => {
  if (data) {
    // Run side effects for cached data
    console.log('Cached data:', data);
  }
}, [data]);
```
