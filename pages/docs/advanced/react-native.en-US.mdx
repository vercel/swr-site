Unlike React running inside the browsers, React Native has a very different user experience. For example there is no “tab focus”, switching from the background to the app is considered as a “focus” instead.
To customize these behaviors, you can replace the default browser `focus` and `online` events listeners with React Native’s app state detection and other native ported API, and configure SWR to use them.

## Example

### Global Setup

You can wrap your app under `SWRConfig` and preconfig all configurations there

```jsx
<SWRConfig
  value={{
    /* ... */
  }}
>
  <App>
</SWRConfig>
```

### Customize `focus` and `reconnect` Events

There're few configurations you need to take care of such as `isOnline`, `isVisible`, `initFocus` and `initReconnect`.

`isOnline` and `isVisible` are functions that return a boolean, to determine if the application is "active". By default, SWR will bail out a revalidation if these conditions are not met.

When using `initFocus` and `initReconnect`, it's required to also set up a [custom cache provider](/docs/advanced/cache). You can use an empty `Map()` or any storage you prefer.

```jsx
<SWRConfig
  value={{
    provider: () => new Map(),
    isOnline() {
      /* Customize the network state detector */
      return true
    },
    isVisible() {
      /* Customize the visibility state detector */
      return true
    },
    initFocus(callback) {
      /* Register the listener with your state provider */
    },
    initReconnect(callback) {
      /* Register the listener with your state provider */
    }
  }}
>
  <App />
</SWRConfig>
```

Let's take `initFocus` as example:

```jsx
import { AppState } from 'react-native'

// ...

<SWRConfig
  value={{
    provider: () => new Map(),
    isVisible: () => { return true },
    initFocus(callback) {
      let appState = AppState.currentState

      const onAppStateChange = (nextAppState) => {
        /* If it's resuming from background or inactive mode to active one */
        if (appState.match(/inactive|background/) && nextAppState === 'active') {
          callback()
        }
        appState = nextAppState
      }

      // Subscribe to the app state change events
      const subscription = AppState.addEventListener('change', onAppStateChange)

      return () => {
        subscription.remove()
      }
    }
  }}
>
  <App>
</SWRConfig>
```

For `initReconnect`, it requires some 3rd party libraries such as [NetInfo](https://github.com/react-native-netinfo/react-native-netinfo) to subscribe to the network status. The implementation will be similar to the example above: receiving a `callback` function and trigger it when the network recovers from offline, so SWR can start a revalidation to keep your data up-to-date.
