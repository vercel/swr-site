# Understanding SWR

## State Machine

`useSWR` returns `data`, `error`, `isLoading`, and `isValidating` depending on the state of the `fetcher` function. This diagrams describe how SWR returns values in some scenarios.

### Fetch and Revalidate

This pattern is to fetch data and revalidate it later.

### Key Change

This pattern is to fetch data and change the key and revalidate it later.

### Key Change + Previous Data

This pattern is to fetch data and change the key and revalidate it later with the `keepPreviousData` option.

### Fallback

This pattern is to fetch data and revalidate it later with fallback data.

## Return previous data for better UX

When doing data fetching based on continuous user actions, e.g. real-time search when typing, keeping the previous fetched data can improve the UX a lot. `keepPreviousData` is an option to enable that behavior. Here's a simple search UI:

```jsx
function Search() {
  const [search, setSearch] = React.useState('');

  const { data, isLoading } = useSWR(`/search?q=${search}`, fetcher, {
    keepPreviousData: true
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={search}
        onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />

      <div className={isLoading ? "loading" : ""}>
        {data?.products.map(item => <Product key={item.id} name={item.name} />)
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

With `keepPreviousData` enabled, you will still get the previous data even if you change the SWR key and the data for the new key starts loading again.

## Dependency Collection for performance

SWR only triggers re-rendering when the states used in the component have been updated. If you only use `data` in the component, SWR ignores the updates of other properties like `isValidating`, and `isLoading`. This reduces rendering counts a lot. More information can be found [here](/docs/advanced/performance#dependency-collection).
