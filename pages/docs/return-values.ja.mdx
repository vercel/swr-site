# Return Values

```js
const { data, error, isLoading, isValidating, mutate } = useSWR(key, fetcher, options)
```

- `data`: data for the given key resolved by `fetcher` (or undefined if not loaded)
- `error`: error thrown by `fetcher` (or undefined)
- `isLoading`: if there's no data returned by the fetcher, not fallback or previous data
- `isValidating`: if there's a request or revalidation loading
- `mutate(data?, options?)`: function to mutate the cached data [(details)](/docs/mutation)

## The Patterns of the Return Values

The following is diagrams how SWR returns values.

### Normal

This pattern is to fetch data and revalidate it later.

### Key Change

This pattern is to fetch data and change the key and revalidate it later.

### Key Change + Previous Data

This pattern is to fetch data and change the key and revalidate it later with the `keepPreviousData` option.

### Fallback

This pattern is to fetch data and revalidate it later with fallback data.

### Key Change + Fallback

This pattern is to fetch data and change the key and revalidate it later with fallback data.

### Key Change + Previous Data + Fallback

This pattern is to fetch data and change the key and revalidate it later with the `keepPreviousData` option and fallback data.
