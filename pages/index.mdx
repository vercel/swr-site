**SWR** is a React Hooks library for remote data fetching.

The name “SWR” is derived from `stale-while-revalidate`, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy popularized by [HTTP RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861). 
SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.

  With SWR, components will get a stream of data updates <strong>constantly</strong> and <strong>automatically</strong>.
  <br/>
  And the UI will be always <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>reactive</strong>.

## Overview

```jsx
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
```

In this example, the `useSWR` hook accepts a `key` string and a `fetcher` function. `key` is a unique identifier of the data (normally the API URL) 
and will be passed to `fetcher`. `fetcher` can be any asynchronous function which returns the data, you can use the native fetch or tools like Axios.

The hook returns 2 values: `data` and `error`, based on the status of the request.
